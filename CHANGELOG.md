## [0.0.5-**e87c7d0**] - 2021-12-29

#### Initial release
* Starting at 0.0.5, because why not? ðŸ˜º
* Initial build with the following feature set:
    - /id on reply.
    - /mute indefinitely on reply.
    - /ban indefinitely on reply.
    - /unmute on reply.
    - /unban on reply.
    - /dog post random dog photo.
    - /cat post random cat photo.
    - /chat display group chat information.
    - /about display information about this bot.
    - /uptime display current bot uptime.
    - /pin pin a message.
    - /perms display group chat user permissions.
    - /admins return list of group chat admins.

    - When @PuddingBot is shut down for
       maintenance or due to an error,
       post a message to a designated
       channel.

    #### Known Bugs:

    - /unban kicks a user when used on non-banned user already in group.
    - /pin is admin-only, currently.
       Not technically a bug.
       Just an oversight.
    - Bot doesn't yet check whether a user is
       already muted/unmuted/banned, so
       running the command repeatedly
       will always return a bot response.
    - Lots of missing error handling and corner cases.
